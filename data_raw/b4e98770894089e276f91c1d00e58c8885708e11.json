            "text": "to determine the accuracy of a POC immunoassay to identify a clinically significant immune response to viral and/or bacterial infection. Sixty patients with acute febrile respiratory infection (19 pharyngitis and 41 lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) were enrolled. Participants provided fingerstick blood for immunoassay testing (myxovirus A [MxA] and c-reactive protein [CRP]) and four oropharyngeal samples for viral PCR and routine bacterial cell culture. Avenous blood sample was collected. An ELISAwas used to measure CRP and MxA. Paired serological testing was used to confirm atypical bacteria. A urine sample was provided for Streptococcus and Legionella antigen testing. Patients with suspected LRTI had sputum and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and WBC count measured. Viral infection was confirmed if oropharyngeal PCR was positive for viral pathogens. Bacterial infection was confirmed in positive throat or sputum cultures. Elevated immunoglobulin M antibodies or twofold increase in IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent phase indicated atypical bacteria. Positive Streptococcus or Legionella urine antigen assays also confirmed bacterial infection. The immunoassay correctly categorized subjects as 92% (22/24) negative, 80% (16/20) with bacterial infection, and 70% (7/10) with viral infection. Conclusions: The interplay between an MxA value and a semi-quantitative CRP value can aid in the differentiation of infectious etiology. In isolation, neither MxA nor CRP alone is sensitive or specific. However, the pattern of results in a rapid immunoassay provides a sensitive and specific method to differentiate acute febrile respiratory infections. This diagnostic information may help reduce antibiotic misuse and resistance and lower healthcare costs.",

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious health threats facing the United States. Approximately 80% of all antimicrobials are prescribed in primary care, and up to 80% of these are for respiratory tract indications (1) . In many of these indications, antibiotics are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients (1, 2) . The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States can be attributed to the lack of clinically differentiating features (3, 4) . Although untreated bacterial infections may cause serious complications, treating viral illnesses or non-infective causes of inflammation with antibiotics is not only ineffective but also contributes to the development of resistance, increased costs, and the risk of antibiotic allergy and/or toxicity (5) . Antibiotic-resistant infections add nearly $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs in the United States, not including additional costs to society for lost productivity that may be as high as $35 billion a year. The ideal infectious disease biomarker would impact this health threat through the combination of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic follow-up characteristics (6) .",

Reviewing several systematic analyses of CRP shows that low cutoff values of CRP demonstrate high sensitivity and low specificity for detecting bacterial infection, whereas high cutoff values of CRP show low sensitivity and high specificity for detecting bacterial infection (6, 9, 19, 31) . MxA specifically identifies viral infection; it is not sensitive for bacterial infection. Thus, by simultaneously examining two levels of CRP (]20 mg/L serum equivalent and ]65 mg/L serum equivalent), each in combination with the presence of elevated levels of MxA ( ]40 ng/ml), it is possible to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the CRP marker. The interplay between a semi-quantitative value for CRP and MxA can help to identify patients with a clinically significant underlying immune response consistent with a suspected respiratory infection from those patients representing a microbiologically unconfirmed respiratory illness (MURI). These markers will also simultaneously aid in the differentiation of viral and bacterial acute febrile respiratory infections. Examined together in a 15-min point-of-care (POC) test, these markers provide a sensitive and specific means to assess clinical significance and differentiate acute febrile respiratory infections.",

When asymptomatic control patients are compared with patients with respiratory illnesses, PCR detects the presence of viruses in 19\u00c144% of the control patients, suggesting transient colonization or persistence, most commonly associated with rhinovirus and coronavirus (40, 66\u00c169). Nokso-Koivisto showed that 81% of the children with virus-positive samples had previous respiratory symptoms or had family members with concurrent respiratory symptoms (70) . However, viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, and RSV are rarely detected in asymptomatic subjects, and when present, they suggest active infection (67, 71, 72) . Since these viruses all seem to be rapidly cleared from the respiratory tract after an infection, PCR is a suitable diagnostic method for determining their infection (73) .",

Rhinovirus and coronavirus cause common cold and do not typically cause an invasive infection or fever in immunocompetent hosts, or stimulate IFN or MxA (70, 74) . This suggests that a causal inference based on the detection of these viruses in symptomatic patients should be made with caution. An accompanying In addition, in this study, when a bacterial infection was confirmed by the comparator method, it was deemed a bacterial infection regardless of the presence of any viral co-infection. There is no universally accepted method for determining colonization from active invasive infection or a method for clinically categorizing symptomatic patients without definitive microbiological confirmation of disease. Finally, there is some element of tautology in this study because CRP was used as part of the comparative method. Alternatively, future studies could consider the use of PCT as a surrogate marker for bacterial infection. Despite these limitations, the interplay between a semi-quantitative value for CRP and MxA appears to aid in the identification and differentiation of infectious etiology and warrants further investigation.",

Difficulty in obtaining relevant specimens, the low sensitivity or specificity of the tests used, high costs, and the absence of test results within the critical window for initiating adequate treatment often result in the prescription of antibiotic therapy in the absence of a bacterial infection. Empiric treatment is especially prevalent in young children who cannot verbalize their symptoms and in the outpatient setting where access to laboratory diagnostics is limited. Independently, antigen testing, cell culture, and PCR cannot differentiate active invasive infection from bacterial or viral colonization. However, microbiological confirmation in the presence of an elevated host immune response is more indicative of a clinically significant infection requiring therapeutic intervention.",
